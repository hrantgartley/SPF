While project managers are responsible for a lot of things in a 
project from start to finish, it is not impossible to do so with
proper planning and structure.

1) Defining clear goals and priorities: this is the first step of 
balancing day-to-day activities. This can help project managers 
focus on what is the more important and delegate/allocate resources
accordingly

2)Building a good team: since the nature of project managing is not 
a solo job building a team that you can trust is crucial. By delegating
tasks to members of the team, project managers can then focus their attention
on more higher-up responsiblities.

3)Communication: being a project manager means that you need to be able to 
regularly communicate with team members, stakeholders, and possibly other 
project managers working in other departments.
